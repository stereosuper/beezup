== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a script? =

You can add a script by navigating to the Tracking Scripts Manager menu in the sidebar, and selecting Add New Tracking Script.

= How do I delete a script? =

On the Tracking Script Manager menu in the sidebar, you can delete a script like you would a normal post.

= How do I reorder scripts? =

Inside the script post, in the right hand sidebar underneath the publish options; there is an order field. Lower numbers mean higher priority.

= Using the body location =

To use the body script location, you will need to add a line of PHP to directly after the opening `<body>` tag in your theme's files. Typically this can be found in header.php but can vary theme to theme. 

`<?php do_action('wp_body_open'); ?>`

After that line is added to your theme, when creating or editing a script; you can select the "After `<body>`" script location for that script to appear.
